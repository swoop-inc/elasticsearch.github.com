h1. Plugins

p. Plugins are a way to enhance the basic elasticsearch functionality in a custom manner. They range from adding custom mapping types, custom analyzers (in a more built in fashion), native scripts, custom discovery and more.

h2. Installing plugins

p. Installing plugins can either be done manually by placing them under the @plugins@ directory, or using the @plugin@ script. Several plugins can be found under the "elasticsearch":https://github.com/elasticsearch organization in GitHub, starting with @elasticsearch-@.

p. Starting from 0.90.2, installing plugins typically take the form of @plugin --install <org>/<user/component>/<version>@. The plugins will be automatically downloaded in this case from @download.elasticsearch.org@, and in case they don't exist there, from maven (central and sonatype).

Note that when the plugin is located in maven central or sonatype repository, @<org>@ is the artifact @groupId@ and @<user/component>@ is the @artifactId@.

For prior version, the older form is @plugin -install <org>/<user/component>/<version>@

p. A plugin can also be installed directly by specifying the URL for it, for example: @bin/plugin --url file://path/to/plugin --install plugin-name@ or @bin/plugin -url file://path/to/plugin -install plugin-name@ for older version.

p. Starting from 0.90.2, for more information about plugins, you can run @bin/plugin -h@.

h2. Site Plugins

p. Plugins can have "sites" in them, any plugin that exists under the @plugins@ directory with a @_site@ directory, its content will be statically served when hitting @/_plugin/[plugin_name]/@ url. Those can be added even after the process has started.

p. Installed plugins that do not contain any java related content, will automatically be detected as site plugins, and their content will be moved under @_site@.

p. The ability to install plugins from Github allows to easily install site plugins hosted there by downloading the actual repo, for example, running:

<pre class="prettyprint">
# From 0.90.2
bin/plugin --install mobz/elasticsearch-head
bin/plugin --install lukas-vlcek/bigdesk

# From a prior version
bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head
bin/plugin -install lukas-vlcek/bigdesk
</pre>

p. Will install both of those site plugins, with @elasticsearch-head@ available under @http://localhost:9200/_plugin/head/@ and @bigdesk@ available under @http://localhost:9200/_plugin/bigdesk/@.

h2. Mandatory Plugins

p. If you rely on some plugins, you can define mandatory plugins using the @plugin.mandatory@ attribute, for example, here is a sample config:

<pre class="prettyprint">
plugin.mandatory: mapper-attachments,lang-groovy
</pre>

p. For safety reasons, if a mandatory plugin is not installed, the node will not start.
